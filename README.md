# Rob's Bash Setup

This is just a collection of various bits and pieces I use for my bash config. I can't promise they work, or that I completely understand what they all do, but it's useful for me to have them around so I thought it best to back them all up. I also figured some people might find them useful if I put them on GitHub

Special mention should go to:
* [Nathaniel Landau's awesome bash setup, which I shamelessly stole](https://natelandau.com/my-mac-osx-bash_profile/)
* [Pretty ping, which you'll want to install if you don't want this setup to break ping for you](https://github.com/denilsonsa/prettyping)
* [Bat, which you'll want to install if you don't want this setup to break cat for you](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat)
* [This excellent coderwall article on displaying git status in the terminal](https://coderwall.com/p/pn8f0g/show-your-git-status-and-branch-in-color-at-the-command-prompt)
* [Pivotal's workstation setup, which I stole my vim config from](https://github.com/pivotal/workstation-setup)
